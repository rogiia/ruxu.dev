After the unimpressive release of GPT-4.5 a month and a half ago, OpenAI is now releasing a new version - backwards. Today, they released three new models, exclusive to the API: `GPT-4.1`, `GPT-4.1 mini` and `GPT-4.1 nano`. In the benchmarks, GPT-4.1 easily beats GPT-4.5 at a lower price and higher speed. For this reason, OpenAI has said they will be deprecating GPT-4.5 in 3 months time.

While this is a good step ahead for OpenAI, they are still a bit behind Claude and Gemini in some key benchmarks. In SWE-bench, GPT-4.1 gets a 55%, against 70% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and 64% for Gemini 2.5 Pro. In Aider Polyglot, GPT-4.1 gets 53%, while Claude 3.7 Sonnet gets 65% and Gemini 2.5 Pro gets 69%.


On the other hand, GPT-4.1 nano offers a similar price and latency as Gemini Flash 2.0. If the performance of this small model is comparable to Gemini Flash, it can be a great option for simple tasks.
