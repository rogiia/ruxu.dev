> These benchmarks test if AI models can find the right answers to a set of questions we already know the answer to.
> However, real scientific breakthroughs will come not from answering known questions, but from asking challenging new questions and questioning common conceptions and previous ideas.

Interesting reflection from Thomas from HuggingFace. Current LLMs have limited potential to make breakthroughs since they cannot "think out-of-the-box" from their training data. We might be able to give the LLMs the ability to explore outside their known world by mechanisms like reinforcement learning + live environment feedback, or other mechanisms that we haven't thought about yet. Still, significant breakthroughs will be hard for LLMs since the real breakthroughs that make a huge impact are usually very far away from established knowledge - very far from the AI model's current probability space.
